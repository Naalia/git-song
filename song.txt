Hold me closer
Don't let me go over
Hold me closer
(Mhm-mhm) Lock it away
Keep my heart at your place
Pull me closer
'Cause anytime or place I'll be your shield
When you feel
Like you ain't got the fight in you to heal
And when you're weak, in defeat
I need you to know
Baby, I would go to war for you
Build an army if you need me to
'Cause losing me is better than losing you, ah
Don't you know that I would die for you?
If I knew that you would make it through
'Cause losing me is better than losing you, ah
Fast car, and no breaks
You're the rush that I crave
Drive me insane
